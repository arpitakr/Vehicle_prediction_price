# Vehicle_prediction_price
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting vehicle prices based on various features and attributes.

# Overview
The main goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can estimate the price of vehicles. The model uses a dataset with numerous features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and other relevant information to predict the price.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from kaggle. It consists of vehicle listings with multiple attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and price. Due to confidentiality, the original dataset used in this project may not be provided here, but a sample or similar dataset can be used for testing purposes.

# Project Structure
data/: Placeholder directory for the dataset.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks containing the data exploration, pre-processing, modeling, and evaluation.
models/: Saved model files after training.
src/: Python scripts for data pre-processing, model training, and evaluation.
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

# Running the Notebooks
